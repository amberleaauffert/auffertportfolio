        <h4>Get To Know Me</h4>

I am currently a senior at Northwest Missouri State University, triple majoring in Marketing, Business Management, and Management Information Systems, with an emphasis in Web Development. I am in Phi Mu, a sorority on campus, and I am on the executive board for Northwest Homecoming as the Public Relations and Communication Chairwoman. Many of you probably see me working in the Floral Department at Hy-Vee, or helping you at Timbearcats Axe Throwing. </p></div>
        <div class="information"><p>I have a big family, with 3 sisters and a brother. I love to take pictures in my free time, and decided to get more serious about it in college. I have done all kinds of sessions including families, seniors, best friends, couples, and expecting moms. My favorite part of photography is being able to capture raw moments that people can save forever. It is so special to play a big role in people's lives and memories! </p></div>
